# VERPS
Full stack website and database system I wrote in college for the physics collaboration VERITAS

I developed the source code in HTML, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, and MySQL. I also used Ajax techniques. 

The VERITAS physics collaboration focuses on finding out whether very-high energy gamma rays are emitted from various sources (such as stars or galaxies) to better understand these sources. In order to do this, we have an array of telescopes in Arizona, which we point at various sources. Then we analyze the data that the telescopes take concerning the radiation emitted by these various sources.

Since the telescope has to point at various sources, and we need to take hundreds of hours of data for us to fully understand the gamma rays are emitted from these objects, each year "proposals" are submitted by everyone in VERITAS to a committee. In these "proposals," each member lists the sources they are interested in observing, as well as the number of hours they want for observation. The committee then takes these proposals and allots the appropriate time the telescopes should be pointed at each object.

In previous years, this was done by hand. As a result, the post-doc I worked for and I came up with the idea to automatize this procedure, which would greatly reduce the amount of time needed to compile these proposals. In the summer of 2010, I went to a VERITAS collaboration meeting in Montreal, Canada and presented the idea of this proposals system (which we have called VERPS). After gaining the approval of the collaboration, I began writing the source code from scratch.

VERPS drastically improved the accuracy and efficiency of inputs. What once took around 48 hours to organize was now immediately organized. I then used Google Analytics and beta tests to gain feedback from VERITAS members. I continued to add new features to the program.

VERPS has been used by the collaboration since 2012, and as of 2022, they are still using the tool. I wrote around 99% of the source codes. (The 1% includes code my post-doc wrote to implement it onto the VERITAS server and some maintenance) We have received over a 99% approval rating on the project. (only 1 person out of around ~200 people in our collaboration expressed disapproval of the system).
