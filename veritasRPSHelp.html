<h2> General Instructions for the VERPS </h2>

<ol>
<li> Enter the proposal data into the RPS form 
<li> Validate the proposal data for completeness. For this, use the <b>Validate</b> button at the end of each section (cover and targets) on the RPS form. If cookies are enabled in your computer, the validated information will be remembered (this will make you happy in case of blackout!). You can also use the <b>Save</b> button at then bottom of the page to save a text file with your work, that you can upload later.   
<li> Upload a pdf file for your proposal (max 3 pages).
<li> Use the <b>Make cover</b> button to create the cover page of your proposal. Check that everything in the generated pdf corresponds to your proposal. Save the file for your records (you will get another copy by email after submitting the proposal ) 
<li> When you are done, submit the proposal by clicking on the <b>Submit</b> button. You will get a proposal ID and an email with a confirmation receipt with a pdf attachment that will include both the cover and the scientific justification. Your proposal will be stored in a VERITAS offline database at UCSC </ol>

<h2> Specific Help for the VERPS </h2>

Find below specific help on each of the fields. <br/> <br/>

<dl>
<dt> <b>New Proposal/Continue Saved Proposal/Revised submitted Proposal</b></dt>
<dd>- Clicking <b>New Proposal</b> will allow users to submit a new proposal. It also retrieves data from cookies to continue working on the previous proposal. You can save your work on a text file by using the <b>save</b> button at the bottom of the webform.
<dd>- The <b>Continue Saved Proposal </b> will upload a previously saved text file.
<dd>- Clicking <b>Revised submitted Proposal</b> will prompt the user for the Proposal id of a submitted proposal as well as the corresponding PI last name. If either are missing or incorrect, access will be denied. <br />
<br />
The actual proposal form is accessed once either of the above steps is completed. Notice how there are three sections labelled <b>Cover</b>, <b>Target Form</b>, and <b>Science Proposal</b>. By clicking on their the labels or the arrow immediately left of the labels will expand the corresponding part of the form. Clicking the <b>help</b> link will direct users to corresponding part in this help page. 
</dd>
<dl>

<dt><b><a name="#cover"</a>Cover</b></dt>
<dd>- The information needed in this section includes the proposal title, a two line abstract and data on the investigators such as name, university and email. Please note that proper email is important as the proposal system will email you with information on your submitted proposal after submission. Other technical details related to the proposed observations are to be indicated here such as MW requirements, name of the analyzers or if this is part of a PhD thesis. Clicking <b>Validate</b> helps users see what has been filled out already that is required (green) and what still needs to be filled out (red), as well as storing all filled out information in this section as a cookie. Clicking <b>Clear</b> will clear all the information in this section only.</dd>
<br />

<dt><b><a name="#target"</a>Target Form</b></dt>
<dd>- The information in this section can be added in two ways: <b>by hand</b> or <b>through text</b>. The latter option won't be available for this season 2012/2013 to see how the new features we have implemented make it simpler and fast the introduction of the data by hand. Among these new features there is the possibility to duplicate target and to obtain the source coordinates using a name server (SIMBAD).
 
<!-- If <b> by hand</b> is selected, must fill out the required information (see next paragraph). If users select <b>through text</b> users will be prompted to provide a text file (.txt) with source, RA, and Dec information in the following format:<br />

'[source name]' [RA J2000] [Dec J2000]<br />

 RA should be in the form HH MM SS.SS and Dec DD MM SS.S. Below is an example (wrong format - need to fix): <br />
<br />

-->
<dd>-The information needed in this section include Source, right ascension, declination, minimum elevation, requested exposure, minimum exposure, observation mode, number of telescopes, moonlight, weather, when it is observable from, and when it is observable till. RA and dec must be filled in using J2000 HH MM SS.S. Once Source, RA, and dec have been filled properly, the TeVCat Visibility link should be enabled. Clicking <b>Validate</b> helps users see what has been filled out already that is required (green) and what still needs to be filled out (red), as well as storing all filled out information in this section as a cookie. Clicking <b>Clear</b> will clear all the information in this section only.</dd>
<br />

<dt><b><a name="#justification"</a>Science Justification</b></dt>
<dd>- The information needed in this section is the scientific justification attached as a pdf file no more than 3 pages long. Clicking <b>Validate</b> helps users see what has been filled out already that is required (green) and what still needs to be filled out (red), as well as storing all filled out information in this section as a cookie. Clicking <b>Clear</b> will clear all the information in this section only.</dd>
</dl>

Once all required information has been filled, the <b>Submit</b> button on the bottom will be enabled.



<h2> Site under Construction </h2>
Please send Andrew suggestions you might have for improving the site at ajl2174 at columbia.edu, or to Ester at ealiu at astro.columbia.edu
<br />
<br>- Connect to VERITAS DB and check for existing source names, suggested by David Williams <br/>

<br/>
<b>Already Done </b>
<br>- Improved PDF cover, suggested by TAC
<br>- Send cover and scientific justification by email once the proposal has been submitted
<br>- Target section improved: possibility to duplicate target and search for coordinates of a source using SIMBAD - suggestions by Wystan and others 
<br>- Added botton to save txt file, suggested by Reshmi
<br>- Added Target of Opportunity information in cover page, suggested by TAC
