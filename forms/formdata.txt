    Title: Detecting Flaring Blazars Using VERITAS Filler Observations

    Abstract: This proposal requests filler observations of all known Northern 
VHE blazars to identify flaring states.  If an unusually bright flare (5 
times the low-state flux; minimally 10% Crab) is observed, a 2-h 
ToO observation is requested at the next available good-weather 
opportunity.  Similar ToO observations are requested on following 
days if the flare is confirmed and continues.

    Who will analyze and when: All data will be initially processed by automatic next-day pipelines 
running VEGAS and EventDisplay by\r\n10 am Eastern. An 
automatic quality-selected VEGAS pipeline will be run by 5 pm 
Eastern. Final analyses will be prepared by the SAO group.\r\n
